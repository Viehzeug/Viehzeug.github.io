I'm a PhD student in computer science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, although I'm originally from Austria.
I am interested in Machine Learning/AI, Programming Languages, Systems, Mathematics and especially their interaction. My main area of interest are Machine Learning methods that are to some extent reliable, interpretable, explainable or secure. Furthermore I like photography, video games, books, movies and cooking.

### Professionally
 I am part of the [Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab](www.sri.inf.ethz.ch), supervised by [Martin Vechev](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin), since March 2019.
 My publications and further information can be found [on my personal site on the lab website](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/marc).
