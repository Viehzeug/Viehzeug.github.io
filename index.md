I'm a student of computer science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, although I'm from Austria. I'm interested in Machine Learning/AI, Programming Languages, Systems, Mathematics and their interaction. Especially in Machine Learning methods that are to some extent interpretable, explainable and secure. I'm currently tinkering at [SRI](http://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/). Furthermore I like photography, video games, books, movies and cooking.
