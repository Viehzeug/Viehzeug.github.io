I'm a Co-Founder and CEO of [Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai), where we make AI Agents secure.
I'm also a PhD candidate, to defend my dissertation, in the [Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab](www.sri.inf.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich in Switzerland.

Furthermore I like photography, video games, books, movies and cooking.
